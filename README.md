# CProgramming
In script, we have use C language for programming,
Here we have done 6 Task

Section A

Question 1:
Display the diagonal pattern for the string of odd length.

Sample Input 1:
		Enter the string : racecar
	
Sample Output 2:

					e
				c		c
			a				a
		r						r
			a				a
				c		c
					e

Sample Input 2 :
		Enter the string : football

Sample Output 2:
		Not Possible












Question 2 :
Print the following pattern for the given n:

Sample Input 1:
	Enter the number = 3

Sample Output 2:

	1	6	5
		2	4	
			3		

Sample Input 2:
	        Enter the number = 5

Sample Output 2:

	1	12	11	10	9	
		2	13	15	8	
			3	14	7	
				4	6	
					5








Question 3 : 
Print the largest possible for the given string.

Sample Input:
	Enter the number of string to be entered = 2
	Enter the string1 : abdf
	Enter the string2 : hafd

Sample Output:
	String1 : fdba
	String2 : hfda
Question 4:
Print the following pattern for the given input.

	Input:
		Enter the number : 5

	Output:	

		5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5
		5 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5
		5 4 3 3 3 3 3 4 5
		5 4 3 2 2 2 3 4 5
		5 4 3 2 1 2 3 4 5
		5 4 3 2 2 2 3 4 5
		5 4 3 3 3 3 3 4 5
		5 4 4 4 4 4 4 4 5
		5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5







Question 5:
Check whether the given string has characters of equal difference or unequal difference.

Sample Input 1:
	Enter the string : abcdefg
Sample Output 1:
Equal difference.

Sample Input 2:
	Enter the string : adxz
Sample Output 2:
	Unequal difference.

Explanation:

Sample Input 1 :
string = abcdefg
| b - a | = | f - g | = 1
	| c - b | = | e - f | = 1
| d - c | = | d - e | = 1
Since the difference between the characters are same throughout i.e 1, therefore the given string is unique.

Sample Input 2 :
string = adxz
	| d - a | ! = | x - z | 
Since the difference between the characters (d - a) and (x - z) are not equal, therefore the given string is not unique.

Question 6:
Find one of the maximum possible palindrome in the given string.

	Input:
		Enter the string : madameaga

	Output:

		aamdmaa


	Input:
		Enter the string : abcdefghfgbeadc

	Output:

		abcdefghgfedcba


Question 7:
Print the distinct words in the given string.

	Sample Input 1:
		Enter the string : This is Zoho and Zoho is good

	Sample Output 1:
The distinct words are : This is Zoho and good



Sample Input 2:
Enter the string : we develop software we craft software

Sample Output 2:
The distinct words are : we develop software craft
